# Image Search

SPA used to search for royalty free images. The API that is driving the image results is provided by PEXELS. I've developed this application to familiazrize myself with how API calls are maanged between a front-end and back-end.

## Local Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install and run locally.

##### *Be sure to follow the startup process for both the backend and frontend folders:
#### install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### start the service
```bash
npm start
```
